# Interactive Sales Dashboard â€“ Excel Project

## Project Overview
This interactive sales dashboard was built using Microsoft Excel, incorporating dynamic charts, slicers, and visualizations to give clear and actionable insights from sales data. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, customer trends, and product category contributions over multiple years and across various US states.

## Key Insights Derived from the Dashboard

### 1. Sales Distribution by Category
- Phones, Chairs, and Storage are the top three product categories contributing the highest sales revenue.
- Smaller categories like Fasteners and Labels contribute minimally to overall sales, suggesting potential areas for product rationalization or improvement.

### 2. Profit Trends Over Time
- Technology products consistently show the highest profit growth from 2014 to 2017, making it the most profitable category.
- Office Supplies have a steady but moderate profit contribution.
- Furniture sales, while lower in profit, show consistent year-over-year performance.

### 3. Regional Sales Performance (Sales by State)
- Certain states (e.g., California and New York, as seen from the heat intensity on the map) significantly outperform others in sales.
- Lower-performing states might need targeted marketing or distribution strategies.

### 4. Customer Count Growth
- Customer acquisition has steadily increased from 2014 to 2017.
- The largest customer base was observed in 2017, reflecting successful expansion or customer retention strategies.

### 5. Top Performing Customers
- The dashboard highlights the Top 5 customers who contribute the most profits, allowing for focused relationship management and retention efforts.

### 6. Monthly Sales Seasonality
- Sales fluctuate throughout the year, with noticeable peaks during mid-year and end-of-year months, likely driven by seasonal promotions or purchasing cycles.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Excel Features: PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting
- Charts Used: Bar charts, Line graphs, Area charts, Pie charts, and Heat Maps
- Interactivity: Slicers enable users to filter by Category and Year dynamically, making the dashboard easy to explore without modifying formulas or charts.

## Purpose of the Project
This project simulates a real-world sales reporting scenario where stakeholders need to quickly assess sales performance, customer growth, and profitability across products and geographies.
It demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, visual storytelling, and creating interactive Excel dashboards for business decision-making.
